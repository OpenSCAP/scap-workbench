== Typical Use Case

Let us go over a common use case. Any section marked (optional) can be skipped
if you do not need the feature explained in it.

=== Obtain SCAP content

Even before we start the workbench we need to find content to open. Probably
the best choice right now is scap-security-guide
footnote:[https://www.open-scap.org/security-policies/scap-security-guide/].

It is possible that scap-security-guide has already been installed on your
system as a dependency of scap-workbench. If it isn't, install it:

From the package repository (YUM):: # yum install scap-security-guide
From the package repository (APT):: # apt-get install scap-security-guide
From upstream source (for advanced users or content developers)::
 . $ git clone https://github.com/OpenSCAP/scap-security-guide.git ; cd scap-security-guide
 . $ make

==== Alternative SCAP content (optional)
[[alternative-contents]]
 * http://usgcb.nist.gov/usgcb/rhel_content.html[USGCB for RHEL5] - XCCDF and OVAL, only suitable for RHEL5.
 * https://github.com/OpenSCAP/sce-community-content[SCE Community Content] - Uses SCE, only suitable for Fedora.

=== Start SCAP Workbench

After installation a new application entry for SCAP Workbench should appear
in your desktop environments application menu.

[[img-starting-scap-workbench]]
.SCAP Workbench application entry in GNOME 3
image::starting_scap_workbench.png[align="center"]

In case you cannot find any SCAP Workbench application icon / entry to click,
press Alt+F2 to bring up the run command dialog (works in Gnome 3 and KDE 4),
type 'scap-workbench' and confirm.

SCAP Workbench should start and if you installed scap-security-guide from
your package repository, workbench will immediately open a dialog letting you
choose which SSG variant you want to open.

[[img-ssg-integration]]
.SSG integration dialog
image::ssg_integration.png[align="center"]

For the remainder of this guide let us assume that you chose Fedora. All the
instructions are similar on other variants.

[[img-default-content-opened]]
.Fedora SSG content opened in workbench
image::default_content_opened.png[align="center"]

=== Open Different Content (optional)

Selecting *Other SCAP content* in the SSG integration dialog or choosing the *Open Other content*
action from the File menu (top of the main window) will enable
you to change opened content. Keep in mind that workbench only supports opening
XCCDF, Source DataStream, SCAP RPM files or their bzip2 variants. Everything else will
result in an error dialog being shown.

If your content provider ships both XCCDF and Source DataStream files you are
better off using Source DataStream. Especially if you want to perform remote
scans where workbench only supports datastreams so far.

SCAP RPM will usually contain a tailoring file, as well as input file in the form of XCCDF
or Source DataStream.

****
Only one content file can be opened by a single SCAP Workbench instance.
Opening a different content file will *DESTROY* all your customization changes
and you will also *LOSE* profile selection.

The one content file however can contain multiple checklists if it is a datastream.
Changing the checklist will *CHANGE* profile selection and *MAY* make your customization
unusable / not applicable to the newly selected checklist.

As a general rule, make sure you have the right file and right checklist
selected before proceeding to customization and/or profile selection.
****

To prevent workbench from opening default content when it starts you can either
uninstall the content or pass a different path via command line.

 scap-workbench PATH_TO_SCAP_CONTENT

See <<alternative-contents, alternative contents>> for more content choices.

****
If you pass a path that is invalid or points to a file that is not valid XCCDF or SDS,
workbench will show an error dialog and open default content automatically.
****

=== Load a Ready-Made Customization (XCCDF tailoring file) (optional)

In case you have prepared or were given a tailoring file for your specific evaluation
use-case, you can load by clicking on the *Customization* combobox and selecting
the *Select customization file...* option. This will bring up a file open dialog where
you can select your customization file (XCCDF tailoring file).

****
Loading a customization file will *DESTROY* all your customization changes that you
have done either by customizing profiles or loaded from another customization file.
****

****
Only XCCDF 1.2 supports tailoring officially. The OpenSCAP project has an extension
that allows tailoring files to be used with XCCDF 1.1 so SCAP Workbench supports
that as well. The details are out of scope of this document but keep in mind that
tailoring of an XCCDF 1.1 file might not work with scanners other than openscap.
****

[[img-opening-tailoring-file]]
.Opening a tailoring file
image::opening_tailoring_file.png[align="center"]

=== Choose a Profile

****
XCCDF profiles are in essence configurations of the content for a particular
evaluation scenario. XCCDF profiles decide which rules are selected and which
values they use - e.g.: one profile may enforce password length to be at least 10
characters, a different one may be more lenient and enforce password length of
at least 6 characters.

For more details refer to the
http://scap.nist.gov/specifications/xccdf/index.html[XCCDF specification].
****

****
This section mentions *(default)* profile a lot. The word 'default' is not
a very fortunate choice considering what the profile does. This profile is
empty, it has no select or refine-value elements.

Whenever we talk about this special profile we use '(default)' with braces
to avoid confusion. As a contrast, 'default profile' means the profile
selected by default.
****

All SCAP content has at least one profile - the *(default)* profile
which is an empty profile that does not change selection of any rules and
does not affect values passed to any of the checks. Only rules with the
selection attribute equal to "true" and all their ancestor xccdf:Group selection
attribute also being "true" are evaluated in a *(default)* profile.

It depends on the content, but the *(default)* profile is unlikely to be
the choice you want. SCAP Workbench will only choose it implicitly if there
are no other profiles. The first profile that is not the *(default)* profile
will be chosen.

Use the *Profile* combobox to change which profile will be used for subsequent
evaluation. When SCAP Workbench is not evaluating, it previews selected rules
of the current profile. This list will refresh every time you customize a profile
or select a different one.

=== Customize the Selected Profile (optional)

After you have selected the profile suitable for your desired evaluation, you
still may want to make slight alterations to it. Most commonly, it would be
unselecting that one undesirable rule that makes no sense on this particular
machine.

Make sure your desired profile is selected and click *Customize*.

In case the *Customize* action will create a new profile you will be presented
with a dialog that lets you choose an ID for that new profile. Choose the ID
wisely, you may need it later.

[[img-customizing-ssg-profile]]
.Customizing scap-security-guide's "common" profile
image::customizing_ssg_profile.png[align="center"]

A new modal window will be shown, you cannot interact with the rest of the
application until you either confirm or discard your customization changes.

In the example case, we do not care about minimum and maximum age for passwords
and do not want the rules failing for our configuration. Let us expand the
tree until we find the offending rules and unselect them both.

[[img-tailoring-dialog-opened]]
.Unselecting minimum and maximum password age rules
image::tailoring_dialog_opened.png[align="center"]

****
This customization dialog supports undo/redo. If you accidentally make changes
you want to undo, press CTRL+Z or click the *Undo* button.

The entire undo history can be shown by clicking on the Undo History button.

Keep in mind that the undo history gets lost when you confirm or discard
customization changes and the window is closed.
****

[[img-tailoring-undo-history]]
.Example of Undo History
image::tailoring_undo_history.png[align="center"]

You can also change variables that will later be used for evaluation. See the
following example, where we set minimum password length to 14.

[[img-tailoring-set-value]]
.Set minimum password length to 14
image::tailoring_set_value.png[align="center"]

Changes to the values are applied immediately as you change the combobox or
editbox.

After desired customization changes are done, click *OK* to get back
to the previous GUI. To undo all of the changes to the profile, click
*Cancel*. If you want to delete the profile from tailoring, click *Delete profile*.

All of these options will close the customization window.

=== Save content (optional)

==== Save just the customization file

Click *File -> Save Customization Only* and choose the destination file. Workbench
saves just the customization which you can use with the content you opened.

****
If XCCDF version of the content is lower than 1.2 footnote:[Tailoring is not officially
supported in XCCDF 1.1.x, the feature has been added in 1.2] workbench will create
a file that is not compliant to the official specification! OpenSCAP and SCAP Workbench
support tailoring in XCCDF 1.1.4 through an extension. Keep in mind that such content
will work in openscap powered tools but may not work in tools from other vendors!
****

==== Save all content into a directory

Select *File -> Save All* and choose *Into a directory*. After selecting the destination
directory SCAP Workbench exports both input content and a tailoring file there.

==== Save as RPM

Select *File -> Save All* and choose *As RPM*. A dialog will pop-up asking for details regarding
the RPM that will be generated. Choose the desired name of the package and leave the other
fields at their default settings and confirm the dialog.

Another dialog opens, this time asking for destination directory where SCAP Workbench
will create the RPM.

[[img-tailoring-dialog-opened]]
.Saving Fedora scap-security-guide content as RPM
image::save_as_rpm_dialog.png[align="center"]

****
The resulting RPM contains both the input content and the tailoring file. It will not contain
any evaluation result files (HTML report, ARF, XCCDF results).
****

****
Please note that the resulting RPM will not be signed! This means that it can be rejected
for deployment by system management tools like Spacewalk.

If you wish to sign the resulting RPM, make sure you have *rpm-sign* installed,
the */usr/bin/rpmsign* binary available and GPG as well as related rpmmacros setup.
footnote:[Please see http://fedoranews.org/tchung/gpg/ for a detailed write-up on how to sign RPMs]
Then execute:

$ rpm --addsign my-content-1.1.noarch.rpm

The resulting package is signed and ready to use, provided that your desired
system management tool accepts the key you used.
****

=== Choose the Target Machine

SCAP Workbench will scan *local machine* by default. However, you can also
scan remote machines using SSH.

To scan a remote machine, select *Remote Machine (over SSH)* in the *Target*
combobox. A pair of input boxes will appear. Input the desired username and
hostname and select the port. Username and hostname should be put into the
first editbox in the format commonly accepted by ssh - *username@hostname*.
Make sure the machine is reachable, the selected user can log in over SSH, and has
sufficient privileges to evaluate the machine.

****
The target machine must have the *oscap* tool of version 0.8.0 or greater
installed and in $PATH!

You can achieve that by installing *openscap-scanner* on the target machine.
If *openscap-scanner* is not available install *openscap-utils* instead.
****

****
Only a Source DataStream can be used to scan a remote machine. Plain XCCDF
files are not supported yet!
****

[[img-scanning-remote-machine]]
.Selecting a remote machine for scanning
image::scanning_remote_machine.png[align="center"]

=== Enable Online Remediation (optional)

****
Remediation is an automatic attempt to change configuration of the scanned
machine in a way that fixes a failed rule result. By fixing, we mean changing
configuration, ensuring that the rule would pass in the new configuration.

The success of automatic remediation greatly depends on content quality and
could result in broken machines if not used carefully!
****

The *Remediate* checkbox will do remediation as part of the evaluation
itself. After evaluation is done, *oscap* will go over failed rules and attempt
to remediate each of them.

The rules that were remediated will show up as *fixed* in the rule result list.

=== Evaluate

Everything is set up we can now start the evaluation. Click the *Scan*
button to proceed. If you selected a remote machine target, SSH may ask you
for a password at this point.

****
SCAP Workbench never processes your SSH password in any way. Instead an ssh
process is spawned which itself spawns the ssh-askpass program which asks
for the password.
****

If you selected to scan the local machine, workbench will show a dialog
that allows you to authenticate and scan the machine with superuser rights.
You can click *Cancel* if you wish to scan using your current permissions.

****
If pkexec is not available or no policykit agent is running, the privilege
escalation dialog is not shown and SCAP Workbench will scan using
your current permissions. If you need superuser permissions, you can start
SCAP Workbench using sudo or as root.

 $ sudo scap-workbench
****

The application now starts the *oscap* tool and waits for it to finish,
reporting partial results along the way in the rule result list. Keep in mind
that the tool cannot guess how long processing of any particular rule will
take. Only the number of rules that have been processed and the number that
remain are used to estimate progress. Please be patient and wait for
oscap to finish evaluation.

****
You can cancel the scan at any point by clicking the *Cancel* button. Canceling
will only give you partial results in the evaluation progress list, you cannot
get HTML report, XCCDF results or ARF if you cancel evaluation!
****

After you press the *Scan* button, all the previous options will be disabled
and greyed-out. You cannot change them until you press the *Clear* button
which will clear all results.

=== View and Analyze Results

After evaluation finishes, you should see three new buttons: *Clear*, *Save Results* and *Show Report*.

****
Pressing Clear will *permanently* destroy scan results! This action cannot
be undone.
****

Pressing *Show Report* will open the HTML report of the evaluation in your
internet browser.

****
SCAP Workbench will open the report in the default web browser set in your
desktop environment. Make sure you have a browser installed.

If nothing happens after pressing the button, check which browser is the default.
See *System Settings -> System Info -> Default Applications* in GNOME 3 or
*System Settings -> Default Applications* in KDE4.

In case you still cannot get SCAP Workbench to open a browser, save the
report as an HTML file on your hard drive and open it manually.
****

Your evaluation results can be saved in several formats:

HTML report:: Human readable and convenient, not suitable for machine processing.
Can be examined by any web browser.
XCCDF result:: Machine readable file with just the results, not suitable for
manual processing. Requires a special tool that can parse the format.
ARF:: Also called result datastream. Packs input content, asset information
and results into a single machine readable file, not suitable for manual processing.
Requires a special tool that can parse the format.

If you are unsure which format to choose for archiving results, *XCCDF Result*
is commonly supported and HTML reports can be generated from it with
the *oscap* tool.

****
The ARF file is the only format that contains everything the evaluation has generated.
On top of XCCDF results, it contains OVAL results, SCE results (if any),
asset identification data. If you want to keep all of the generated data, choose ARF
when archiving.

However, ARF files are not as well supported by SCAP toolchains as XCCDF result files are.
XCCDF result files can be generated from ARF files, this operation is called *ARF splitting*.

== Customization vs Tailoring

The XCCDF specification calls the concept of profile customization *tailoring*.
While this word fits the concept it's generally misunderstood by users. That's why
workbench will often use words like *Customize* or *Customization file* to
describe tailoring. *XCCDF tailoring file* is still used for the file format itself.

If you are familiar with XCCDF specification keep in mind that customization is
the same thing as tailoring.

== Options for advanced users

Passing *--skip-valid* on the command line will disable all validation.
Both while opening the files and when scanning. This option is discouraged and
should only be used by content creators and/or people who really know what they
are doing.

== Where to Get Help?

You ask for help with the application using

 * #openscap channel on irc.freenode.net
