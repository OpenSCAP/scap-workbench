#------------- Updated section to support creating a dmg in macOS 10.13+ -------------#
# Changes made by Carlos Matos <cmatos@redhat.com
# Issues identified when trying to port CI from Travis to Github Actions. Using macOS 10.14+
# would cause the CI job to fail due to security enhancements made after High Sierra. This
# was essentially causing the original applescript to timeout after it's default 2 minute waiting
# period. After making several attempts to work around this issue - it became clear that this was
# going to take too much effort - if it even would work at all. I began looking at alternative
# solutions, which lead me to a couple of open source projects created by people who simply wanted
# to make the process of creating a dmg easier. After testing dmgbuild and appdmg, I settled with
# appdmg since it was easy to port our existing configuration to it.
